- This is the only AGENTS.md, there are no recursive AGENTS.md
- Do NOT run setup.py, you do not have a working build environment
- Do NOT run pre-commit, it is not setup
- Do NOT add tests or try to run tests unless the user has given specific
  instructions on how to do so.
- Do NOT attempt to install dependencies, you do not have Internet access
- When you are ready to make a PR, do exactly these steps:
  - git stash -u
  - git reset --hard $(cat /tmp/orig_work.txt) # NB: reset to the LOCAL branch, do NOT fetch
  - git stash pop
  - Resolve conflicts if necessary
